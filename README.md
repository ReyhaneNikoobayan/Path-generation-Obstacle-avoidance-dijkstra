# Path planning of robot and avoiding obstacle

## In this project, I implemented a MATLAB function that plans a path for a robot by Road Mapping using the Dijkstra

The function receives:

- N → Number of obstacles
- Sxi, Syi, Exi, Eyi → Coordinates of the two endpoints forming the obstacle
- SxN, SyN, ExN, EyN 
- X_start, Y_start  →  coordinates of the starting point
- X_end, Y_end  →  coordinates of the final destination

The output is the path 

## For the following obstacles and conditions the path whcih is generated by our function is :
